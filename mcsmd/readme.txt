== Description ==

Display your Minecraft server status on your WordPress site. Basic mode works without any Minecraft plugin.
Server Status for MC by MrDino lets you show a clean, modern status card for your Minecraft server.

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin.
3. Go to **Settings → Server Status for MC by MrDino** and enter your server details.
4. Use the shortcode `[mcsmd_status]` - shows the main Minecraft server status card (IP, version, MOTD, banner, players, ping, etc.).
4b. Use the shortcode `[mcsmd_players]` – shows only the online players list, with search box and sorting options.

== Quick start ==
Enter your Minecraft server address and port in the “Basic server settings” section above and save the changes.
Optionally adjust the display options (banner, MOTD, dark mode, player list, etc.).
Create or edit a page, paste the shortcode you want to use and publish the page.
Tip: the status and players cards auto-refresh in the background, so visitors will see updated information without reloading the whole page.
